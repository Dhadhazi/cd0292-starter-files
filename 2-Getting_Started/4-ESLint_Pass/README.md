# Instructions

Your goal is to set up an NPM project which will lint and prettify the code in `index.js`.

You are being supplied the configuration files for EsLint and Prettier `./.prettierrc` & `./eslint.config.mjs`. Run `ls -a` in terminal to see invisible files are there. You do not need to make any changes to them.

Configure the NPM project, install the proper node modules. You will also need to include scripts that run eslint and prettier.

There are errors in the `index.js` file. Run the scripts and fix the errors based off the results displayed in the console.
