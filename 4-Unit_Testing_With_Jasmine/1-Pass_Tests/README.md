This project is already configured to work with TypeScript and Jasmine. 

Your task is to write at least one spec per function used on the `index.ts` file. There should be at least 7 specs. You must use at least 5 different matchers for your tests. All of your specs can be on 1 spec file. 

Make sure to build your TypeScript project and make certain all of your tests pass. Check the `package.json` file to view scripts available.
