# Instructions

The Express server is already complete. Create 3 endpoints. Then write middleware that logs the endpoint to the console when visited. Only include the middleware on 2 of the 3 endpoints. Build your TypeScript project and confirm that your logger works on the build.

Example: "/countries was visited"
